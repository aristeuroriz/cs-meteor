# joker-meteor
A simple generator for a modern meteor app.

Inspired by Rails for its powerful generators and [The Meteor Chef's Base](https://github.com/themeteorchef/base).

The aim is to provide a simple base for modern meteor apps and to help you automate all the boring stuff (creating new resources / collections / views / ...) to let you focus on the **interesting code part**.

Here is how to use it :

```
$> yo joker appname
```

You just created the base skeleton for your new meteor application!
